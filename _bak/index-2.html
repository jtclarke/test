						<h4>about ZEE.</h4>
						<div class="span-13 last subsect">
							<p>ZEE is a rigorous mindscape; a hallucinatory architecture of light; a dream machine.</p>
  
							<p>An enclosed space is filled with a dense, odorless fog that completely obscures the walls, floor and ceiling. Individuals freely roam this environment, while flickering light filters through the haze, inducing hallucinations and sensory distortions within each viewer. A droning soundscape intensifies this full-immersion experience, shifting dynamically according to changes in the color, frequency and intensity of the light.</p>
 
							<p>Exhilarating and meditative, Kurt Hentschlager's pulsing, stroboscopic and mind-altering ZEE pushes the boundaries of human perception and creates an intense audiovisual journey. A constant innovator and one of the most influential figures in the field of contemporary art and technology, Hentschlager merges conceptual art, sound, video, performance, and technology in his large-scale installations. Since launching his career in 1983, his work has been commissioned worldwide, including: NoiseGate 2000 for Creative Time's Art in the Anchorage as part of the Austrian duo Granular-Synthesis, representing Austria at the 2001 Venice Biennale, and his most recent installations ZEE, RANGE and KARMA/X are currently touring. <a href="http://www.kurthentschlager.com">www.kurthentschlager.com</a></p>

<p>Kurt Hentschlager, a Chicago-based Austrian artist, was last in NYC as one half of the Austrian duo Granular Synthesis with the spectacular video and sound environment "NoiseGate" in 2000, part of Creative Time's "Art in the Anchorage."</p>

						<h4 class="face-h3">about Kurt.</h4>
						<div class="span-13 last subsect">
							<h3>Kurt Hentschlager</h3>
							<p>Chicago-based Austrian artist Kurt Hentschlager creates audio-visual compositions that lie somewhere in between performance and installation. The immersive nature of his work reflects on the metaphor of the sublime. Trained as a fine artist, in 1983 he began as a sculptor by building surreal machine objects, followed by works with video, computer animation and sound. Between 1992 and 2003 he worked collaboratively as part of the duo Granular Synthesis. His most recent solo work is more poetic and further researches the nature of human perception and accelerated impact of new technologies on individual consciousness. <a href="http://www.kurthentschlager.com">www.kurthentschlager.com</a>

							<p>More than any other concept, "immersion" has become one of the most taken-for-granted expressions in writings on technology, and increasingly used to describe a vast array of different media, creative processes, and ways of audience engagement. From video games and 3D cinema, to new counterinsurgency strategies for simulating theaters of war; from realistic touch feedback medical training systems, to the aesthetics of site specific performance and installation. They all share the same desired effect: collapsing the gap between viewer and work, image and reality, inside and outside. Five distinguished panelists will show and discuss their work in relationship to these and others issues.</p>
							<p>In conjunction with the opening of ZEE, FuturePerfect, CPR-Center for Performance Research, 3LD Art & Technology Center, and PS122 invite you to a panel on Performance, Installation, and Immersion. Participants include: <strong>Kevin Cunningham</strong> (Director, 3-Legged Dog Media and Theater Group), <strong>Kurt Hentschlager</strong> (Artist, Austria/US), <strong>Kora Van den Bulcke</strong> and <strong>Thomas Soetens</strong> (Workspace Unlimited, Artist Collective Belgium/Canada), <strong>Allen Feldman</strong> (Associate Professor, Anthropology, NYU), and others to be announced. Discussants include <strong>Vallejo Gantner</strong> (PS122), <strong>Morgan von Prelle Pecelli</strong> (PS122), <strong>Wayne Ashley</strong> (FuturePerfect), <strong>Dr. Frank Hentschker</strong> (Martin E. Segal Theatre Center, CUNY) and others. <a href="http://www.cprnyc.org">www.cprnyc.org</a></p>

							<p>ZEE is the inaugural event of FuturePerfect, a new initiative that researches and presents hybrid performance practices, media forms, and artistic ideas that continue to emerge as computer technologies and electronic networks mature and become inseparable from contemporary culture. In particular focus is the future of live performance and related visual culture.
